Little part of task I was assigned to

Created for myself for better understanding how Ruby works

How to start:

1 Copy to pc

2 Go to installed progect folder 

3 Type in command prompt:

    bundle install

    ruby parse_oop.rb

And you will get Parser result in JSON:

{                                             
  "url": "https://www.proz.com/profile/52171",
  
  "first_name": "Antonella",                  
  "last_name": "Vallicelli",                  
  "target_lang": "English, Italian, German",  
  "native_lang": "Italian",                   
  "country": "Italy"                          
}
